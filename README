OddsThomas is a betting system which records and odds. 

This system is not currently "working." It mostly works, but don't get too excited I've got to finish it (when I have time).  It was written during the world cup to manage the betting pool. Unfortunatly I couldn't seem to find an odds feed that it could pull from. I woudl love to finish OddsThomas if I can find a feed or if you know of one please let me know micah {/\at\/} druid628 {/\dot\/} com.   

A note of "hope" my plans is to finish this and have it converted over to symfony2 prior to the next world cup ;-)
